# Wtfshouldweeat

wtf should we eat is a website inspired by wtfshouldimakefordinner.com

It compiles a list of recipes I like and restaurants I like to go so that I can quickly decide what to eat.


## How it works

Recepies and restaurants are compiled in a csv file and should be easily editable.
